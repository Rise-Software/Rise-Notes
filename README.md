## Downloads, Contribute and the Insider Program

MSIX packages are available now for the Pre-Alpha 1 build. You can try them by joining the Insider Program! We aren't going to be available in the Microsoft Store for the Pre-Alpha process as we will be releasing many builds over the next few months. Trying to approve each build on a regular basis is just not feasible. 

If you'd like early packages before they're available, join the **Rise** Insider Program. Like to contribute code or translate the app? Click the contribute button! And, if you're already an insider, you can leave the program or change your channel from Insider Settings.

**If you are an Insider already, just click the Download button and you'll be taken to a page to download :)**
