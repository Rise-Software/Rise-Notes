# Notes
WinUI UWP Based Notepad created on VS2019
# Is it near to complete?
Not sure, i will update the Source Code sometimes, adding a list of updates i worked on!
# Can i help?
Of Course, every bug should be deleted so reporting bugs and giving suggestions is always really appreciated!
Also if anyone has free time, i would need an icon for the app as of right now it's just the fluent Notepad icon
# Is this Free? are you working for Money?
Nahh, this is just a fun project i'm working on!
